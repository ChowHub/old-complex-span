After the square goes away, another symmetry picture will appear, and then another square.

At the end of each set of pictures and squares, a recall screen will appear.  Use the mouse to select the squares you just saw.  Try your best to get the squares in the correct order.

It is important to work QUICKLY and ACCURATELY.


You will not be told if your answer to the symmetry picture is correct.

But, after the square recall screen, you will be given feedback about your performance regarding both the number of squares recalled and the percent correct on the symmetry problems.
