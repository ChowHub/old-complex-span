Try to remember where each square was, in the order it was presented in.

After 2 - 5 squares have been shown, you will see a grid of the 16 possible places the squares could have been.

Your job is to select each square in the order presented.  To do this, use the mouse to select the appropriate boxes.  The squares you select will turn red.
