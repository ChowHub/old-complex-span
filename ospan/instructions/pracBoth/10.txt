Now you will practice doing both parts of the experiment at the same time.

In the next practice set, you will be given one of the math problems.  Once you make your decision about the picture, a square will appear on the screen.  Try and remember the letter.

In the previous section where you only solved math problems, the computer computed your average time to solve the problems.  If you take longer than your average time, the computer will automatically move you onto the letter part, thus skipping the True or False part and will count that problem as a math error.
Therefore it is VERY important to solve the problems as quickly and as accurately as possible
