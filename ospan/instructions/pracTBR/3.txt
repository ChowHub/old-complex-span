When you have selected all the letters, and they are in the correct order, hit the EXIT box at the bottom right of the screen.

If you make a mistake, hit the CLEAR box to start over.

If you forget one of the letters, click the BLANK box to mark the spot for the missing letter.

Remember, it is very important to get the letters in the same order as you see them. If you forget one, use the BLANK box to mark the position.

Do you have any questions so far?

When you're ready, click the mouse button to start the letter practice.
