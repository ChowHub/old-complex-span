You will see a number displayed on the next screen, along with a box marked TRUE and a box marked FALSE.

If the number on the screen is the correct answer to the math problem, click on the TRUE box with the mouse.

If the number is not the correct answer, click on the FLASE box.

For example, if you see the problem
(2 * 2) + 1 = 
and the number on the following screen is 5
click the TRUE box, because the answer is correct.

If you see the problem
(2 * 2) + 1 = ?
and the number on the next screen is 6
click the FALSE box, because the correct answer is 5, not 6.

After you click on one of the boxes, the computer will tell you if you made the right choice.

Click the mouse to continue.
